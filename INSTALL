MULTIPLATFORM SUPPORT
=====================
	'libliteidmef' package relies on Autotools suite that guarantees its portability on
	most part of Unix-like systems. More precisely, the 'configure' script generated by
	Autotools programms attempts to guess correct values of system-dependent variables
	during compilation and save them within 'Makefile' file, as well as creates one or 
	more '.h' files containing system-dependent definitions. 

	So far, the package was installed and tested on following platforms:
		Debian 7, Kernel version 3.2.0 (32bit) 
		...

	Further deployments and tests could be achieved, upon request.


PREREQUISITES
=============
	o libpthread
	o gcc >= 4.9.2
	o *NIX operating system (32b CPU)


(UN)INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
==========================

	The build up and installation is as simple as doing the folowing legacy magic 
	incantation at the top level of the package:

		./configure
		make
		sudo make install					

	According to the features of the host system, the libtoolized package could eventually 
	install either both static and shared library versions or one of them.
	For testing the library's installation compile and run samples inside 'tests' folder: 

		cd tests
		./configure
		make

	See README file for further information usefull on working with libliteidmef library. 

	To remove the library just run the command:

		sudo make uninstall


ISSUES
======
	1.	If you got "undefined reference" error(s) while linking your project against shared 
		version of libliteidmef, then try to fix either running the command:

		sudo ldconfig

		or
		setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
