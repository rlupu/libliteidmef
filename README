ABOUT
=====
	Libliteidmef library provides a standardized IDMEF-based notifications 
	management API that can guarrantee interoperability among commercial,
	open source and research systems. IDMEF(Intrusion Detection Message Exchange
	Format) define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information
	of interest to intrusion detecion and response systems and to management
	systems that may need to interact with them [RFC 4765].
	
	The overall design goal was to provide support for IDMEF-based signaling 
	plane deployments for distributed IDS architectures. 

	Libliteidmef is built around the IDMEF message's context core concept, in 
	order to provide the required flexibility and extensibility. Each context 
	input and output could be configured in three modes: file (IDMEF_MODE_FILE), 
	remote generator/consumer(IDMEF_MODE_SOCK) or both of them (IDMEF_MODE_FS). 
	Whenever a new IDMEF notification is received a user-defined callback function 
	is run (see doc files for the API description and samples from test/
	subdirectory).

	NOTE, the current release of the library does not fully implement the standard
	specifications. More specifically, the tags list is incomplete, the IDMEF 
	messages are encoded using one octet UTF-8 (default) method and are wrapped 
	directly on TCP (no IDXP support[RFC 4767] available, yet).  

	A plugin-like model was chosen for the library's implementation. The code 
	was written in C language entirely and compiled with gcc. 

	The current standard does not integrate security mechanisms, therefore add 
	external security services (e.g. TLS/SSL, IPSec, SSH) for IDMEF messages' 
	exchanges protection if required.

(UN)INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
===========================
	See INSTALL file for package's dependencies, (un)installation and testing 
	instructions.


UTILISATION SAMPLE
==================
	Libliteidmef could be integrated into your project either as static or 
	shared library(default) in a traditional way. Linking against libliteidmef
	is as simple as:

		gcc <*.c> `pkg-config --libs libliteidmef-0.1` -o <program>

	
	Further info usefull in working with Libliteidmef, such as API's
	specification (including a diagram-based grammar definition), could be 
	searched for within doc/ subdirectory. Also, by understanding and running 
	samples located within test/ folder the developer could get a hint on how to
 	start coding with Libliteidmef library.
